;;; Commentary:

;; This code provides three things:

;; 1. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements can be converted
;;    into each other:  Place point within a SELECT statement and
;;    type M-x sql-to-update RET in order to transform the SELECT
;;    statement into an UPDATE statement.

;; 2. SQL statement pretty printer:  Place point within a SELECT
;;    statement and type M-x sql-to-select RET in order to rewrite
;;    the SELECT statement.

;; This is usefull if you are developping code that needs a set of
;; INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements for the same table.
;; This set of functions will parse any of these four SQL statements and
;; rewrite them for you (if they are simple, eg. no joins to other
;; tables).  Just mark a SQL statement and call sql-to-insert,
;; sql-to-select, sql-to-update, or sql-to-delete.

;; Obviously this works best if you start with a SELECT or UPDATE
;; statement, because DELETE statements don't have columns and
;; bindvariables, and INSERT statements don't have where clauses.

;; A possible way to customize your .emacs would be to use the following
;; (assuming you are using sql-mode.el from the page mentioned above):

;; (add-hook 'sql-mode-hook
;;        (function (lambda ()
;;                    (local-set-key "\C-cu" 'sql-to-update))))
